# UI-Telemetry

Empowering Game Designers with Seamless UI & Telemetry Integration. Note this project is still experimental. 

I researched the inner workings of Unreal's CommonUI, which operates a UI activatable widget stack and ensures consistent UI styling. 
I wanted to simplify this process for designers by creating a UI system which hides the complexity of managing the UI.

I created a comprehensive telemetry collection system. This can be used for post game anylsis and can collect data on virtually anything given to it. 

Forget complex setups and jargon-filled interfaces. UI-Telemetry has accessible blueprint libraries that allow easy UI development and Telemetry collection, all without touching a single line of code.

I showcase the system's potential with an adorable miniature toon tank shooter. By analyzing telemetry data like projectile patterns and UI interaction, designers can iterate upon their work to improve the player experience.

The project also has a crash reporting server embedded, all crash reports are directed to this server, along with the stack calls which make debugging much easier.

## Telemetry Subsytem

Create a telemetry instance via the ToonTelemetrtySubsytem. This instance represents the CSV file data is written to.

Create an array of column names you want to collect data on.

Save an event via the telemetry instance. Give the event a name and catergory. This is useful when filtering data in the instance

Additionly, we can bind another event when the projectile hits an object. The System is incredibly flexible with the data you want to collect.

Now run your game! Once you've finished playing, go to saved/Telemetry from the project root. Here you can access all the CSVs generated by our telemetry instances. Heres the data from the projectile fire example
